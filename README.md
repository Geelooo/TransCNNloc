# TransCNNLoc: End-to-End Pixel-level Learning for 2D-to-3D Pose Estimation in Dynamic Indoor Scenes

We propose the TransCNNLoc framework, which consists of an encoding-decoding network designed to **learn more robust image features** for camera pose estimation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TransCNNLoc framework exhibits superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and lighting changes, achieving the
best localization accuracy in all 7scenes datasets, with sub-10cm level accuracy.
